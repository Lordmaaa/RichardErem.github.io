I am interested in mastering C language. I am currently working on several projects for my resume including a quiz app named JoJovia, a website called EduTube, and a discord bot that tells you the news in several countries. All in Python because I'm a noob.

My favorite hobby is basketball. Easy way to get some hardcore cardio in + it's fun to play with friends.
